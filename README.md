## Compis

For educational purposes and shouldn't be run in production.
I will be using [HM](https://www2.hm.com/no_no/index.html) as an inspiration to create a shopping website

We will be implementing:
Front end:

- A responsive landing page (Focusing on)
- Showcase of products and filtering functionality.
- Admin Page where admins can add in new products or remove
- Shopping cart where users can add in products

Back end:

- Database which stores the data
- Rest API for CRUD operations.
- Authentication for users

Only the landing page is implemented. So there will only be an example how to run the fron end only.
How to set up the server will be shown later

## Requirements

- npm / yarn

## How to run Front end development mode (RECOMMENDED)

0. Use rename .env.example -> .env
1. run 'yarn' to install dependencies
2. run 'yarn run serve:app'

Open the browser with the url shown in terminal.
